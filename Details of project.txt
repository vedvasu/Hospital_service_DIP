This project shows how image processing can be used to automate the process of pick-up and 
delivery of items as requested by patient with the help of a Robot.

Robotics today has made big strides in helping people automate tasks in many areas like
industries, self-driving cars, and even in healthcare. In the space of healthcare, robots can
help doctors perform remote operations, help diagnose diseases, keep track of medical history
and assist in caring for patients.

We live in a world that is fast moving towards longer life expectancies and nuclear families
giving raise to care centers for the aging population. This creates the need for a large
workforce to care for those who can no longer take care of themselves. Advances in robotics
and computer vision have enabled us to build machines that interact with humans naturally,
require no training to operate and carry out simple tasks. Thus, caretaking is a need that can
be satisfied by robots, specifically designed to fulfill requests for simple services in a timely
manner.

This project works to bring our awareness to the issue of catering to the needs of patients, 
for example, automating the task of serving them, even in the absence of human supervision.

In this theme, the arena is an abstraction of a floor in a hospital, which includes a
Corridor, a Patient zone and a Service zone. The robot is informed of the patients’ requests
via a computer that processes the images from a camera and it autonomously seeks the
provisions to be picked up and delivered to the corresponding patients.
You are free to design the algorithm for (i) detection of provisions requested by the patients,
(ii) matching them with provisions at the Service zone and (iii) delivering them to the patients
in the Patient zone.
